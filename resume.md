## Summary

With an emphasis on systems engineering, I have been responsible for all
parts of the software development process. From hardware selection, through
operating system and package configuration management, through C and C++
development utilizing the latest CUDA, MPI, and cluster management
technologies, and into the build, test, and delivery of high performance
image processing pipelines and web analytics, I have been a key integrator
of high performance mission critical applications.

My passion for fully understanding the entire end to end hardware /
software system has led to invaluable insights and development tasks at all
levels and makes me a key part of any development team. Additionally, my
love of learning and teaching have led me to inspire my teammates to learn
new technologies, and modernize development processes with more efficient
and robust approaches including continuous integration, continuous
delivery, and Agile development.

My wide knowledge base allows me to quickly come up to speed on new
tasks, even when they are outside of my expertise and to provide value and
efficiency, making me an asset to any team or development task.

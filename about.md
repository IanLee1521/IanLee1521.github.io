## Summary

With an emphasis on systems engineering, I have been responsible for all parts
of the software development process. From hardware selection, through operating
system and package configuration management, through C and C++ development
utilizing the latest CUDA, MPI, and cluster management technologies, and into
the build, test, and delivery of high performance image processing pipelines
and web analytics, I have been a key integrator of high performance mission
critical applications.

My passion for fully understanding the entire end to end hardware / software
system has led to invaluable insights and development tasks at all levels and
makes me a key part of any development team. Additionally, my love of learning
and teaching have led me to inspire my teammates to learn new technologies, and
modernize development processes with more efficient and robust approaches
including continuous integration, continuous delivery, and Agile development.

My wide knowledge base allows me to quickly come up to speed on new tasks, even
when they are outside of my expertise and to provide value and efficiency,
making me an asset to any team or development task.
